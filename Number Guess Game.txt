Features:
    1. User must be able to enter a number
    2. The game should tell the user if the generated number is grater or lower than the number he guessed
    3. User wins when his number is the same as the generated number

Design:
    1. The program should generated a number at the beginning
    2. The program should take the user input and store it into a varible
        2a. After that the userNumber and generatedNumber should be compared
        2b. The user wins if the numbers match
        2c. A massage Higher/Lower is shown to the user if the numbers don`t match
    3. The game should restart after displaying the congrats message

implementation:
    Hint: take the input by input element at first demo, take it through mic at second demo
    1. Generate a random number from 1 - 100 and store it into generatedNumber
    2. Get the user input(the value of the input) & store it into userInput;
        2a. compare userInput and the generatedNumber 
        2b. if the userInput is equal to generatedNumber,
            user Wins, display the congrats message
            else 
        2c. if userInput is greater than generatedNumber
            display GO LOWER
            else display GO HIGHER
    3.add a click event at the Play Again button, 
        when we click , the page refreshes

Speechrecognition => Check Methods in MDN
                  => Check Events (result, end ...)

We will use msg div to make changes.

We need to initialize a Speechrecognition object
window.SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || webkit,, Check

let recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition(); => this gives us an object

// Start recognition

// FUNCTION Capture User Speak
    get the message = e. ... ... ...

    writeMessage(msg)
    checkNumber(msg)

// Speak result
add a result event listener on the object, and call the function that captures user speak [onSpeak]

    The function onSpeak will take an e (event) as parameter, so we can check (DOM)

WE HAVE TO CREATE TWO FUNCTIONS

writeMessage => It will write out what user speaks
    it will take a msg as parameter
    change the msgElement html

checkNumber => It will check if it is a valid number, > , < , =
    it will take a msg as parameter
    get the number 
    // Check if valid number
    if not a number 
        append the div This is not a valid number at msgEl
        return;
    
    // Check in range
     > , < 
    
    // Check number
    > random, < random... === random (style the body)

// End SR Service
when speak recognition event ends we will call recognition.start() Again

so, we will ad an end event listener on recognition and we will call recognition.start()
