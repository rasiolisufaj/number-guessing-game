        2c. A massage Higher/Lower is shown to the user if the numbers don`t match
    3. The game should restart after displaying the congrats message

implementation:
    Hint: take the input by input element at first demo, take it through mic at second demo
    1. Generate a random number from 1 - 100 and store it into generatedNumber
    2. Get the user input(the value of the input) & store it into userInput;
        2a. compare userInput and the generatedNumber 
        2b. if the userInput is equal to generatedNumber,
            user Wins, display the congrats message
            else 
        2c. if userInput is greater than generatedNumber
            display GO LOWER
            else display GO HIGHER
